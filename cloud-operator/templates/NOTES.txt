1. **Basic Information**: 
```yaml
{{- if .Release.IsInstall -}}
  Congratulations! You have successfully installed the cloud-operator Helm chart.
{{- else if .Release.IsUpgrade -}}
  Your cloud-operator Helm chart has been upgraded successfully.
{{- end }}

Release Name: {{ .Release.Name }}
Namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. **Access Instructions**: 
```yaml
{{- if .Values.service.type == "LoadBalancer" -}}
  The application is being exposed via a LoadBalancer service. It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
  You can watch the status by running:
    kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -w {{ include "cloud-operator.fullname" . }}

  Once the external IP is available, you can access the application using the following URL:
    http://{{ include "cloud-operator.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}
{{- else if .Values.service.type == "NodePort" -}}
  The application is being exposed via a NodePort service. You can access the application using any node's IP address and the following port:
    http://<NodeIP>:{{ (index .spec.ports 0).nodePort }}
{{- else -}}
  The application is being exposed via a ClusterIP service. You can access the application using the following URL within the cluster:
    http://{{ include "cloud-operator.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}
{{- end }}

3. **Next Steps**: 
```yaml
- To view the application logs, run:
    kubectl logs -l app={{ include "cloud-operator.name" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- To describe the application resources, run:
    kubectl describe deployment {{ include "cloud-operator.fullname" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

4. **Helpful Commands**: 
```yaml
- To get the status of the release, run:
    helm status {{ .Release.Name }}

- To get a list of all resources created by the chart, run:
    kubectl get all -l app={{ include "cloud-operator.name" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- To delete the release, run:
    helm delete {{ .Release.Name }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}
